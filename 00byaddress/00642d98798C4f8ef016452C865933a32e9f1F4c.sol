 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed

 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as

 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure

 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To initialize the implementation contract, you can either invoke the
 * initializer manually, or you can include a constructor to automatically mark it as initialized when it is deployed:

 *
 * Contracts that want to implement ERC165 should inherit from this contract and override {supportsInterface} to check
 * for the additional interface id that will be supported. For example:
 *
 * ```solidity
 * function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public view virtual override returns (bool) {
 *     return interfaceId == type(MyInterface).interfaceId || super.supportsInterface(interfaceId);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Alternatively, {ERC165Storage} provides an easier to use but more expensive implementation.
