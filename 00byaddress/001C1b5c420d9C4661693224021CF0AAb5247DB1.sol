 * This token contract is following the ERC20 standard.
 * It inherits ERC20PermitDelegateTransfer.sol, which extends the basic ERC20 to also allow permit and delegateTransfer EIP-712 functionality.
 * Enforces Sanctions List via the Chainalysis standard interface.
 * The contract contains three roles:
 *  - A minter, that can mint new tokens.
 *  - A burner, that can burn its own tokens, or contract's tokens.
 *  - A pauser, that can pause or restore all transfers in the contract.
 *  - An owner, that can set the three above, and also the sanctionsList pointer.
 * The owner can also set who can use the EIP-712 functionality, either specific accounts via a whitelist, or everyone.

 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed

 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as

 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
