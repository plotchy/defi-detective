    // Token indicates availability to do the swap, here
    // must understand next things:
    //  1. This contract exists in both networks and token must
    //     be registered in both of them but with opposite source/dest
    //  2. If you disable token in source blockchain then you
    //     also have to disable it in dest
    //  3. Our backend is stateless that means that it doesn't
    //     have its database and it can only check transaction validity
    //
    // We support next token types:
    //  1. Mintable - is the token which exists in both networks at
    //     the same time, in other words they exists independently to each
    //     other. When user lock funds in this contract we just burn them
    //     and mint in opposite network. The main problem of such tokens that
    //     contract should be able to do mint/burn operations. The only
    //     possibility to check the consistency of funds is to calc sum of
    //     locked balances in all blockchains and it should be zero.
    //  2. Lockable - is the token which exists only in one network and we want
    //     to created pegged token in another blockchain. It has a bit different
    //     scheme because we don't need to burn tokens, we can just lock them
    //     in source smart contract and mint in destination. If we want to get funds
    //     back we just burn them in destination and transfer in source blockchain.
    //     This scheme is useful for tokens that are already provided in ETH network
    //     and users want to use it in other blockchains.
    //
    // Here is the flow for lockable token:
    //  1. User locks his funds in smart contract and calculates proof
    //  2. He sends proof to oracle, it verified it and if everything is fine
    //     it also returns signature for minting funds in dest blockchain
    //  3. User switch his network and claims his funds from dest blockchain
    //  4. Profit
    //
    // What is proof? Proof is a special array that contains information about transaction
    // and can be verified by smart contract. Here we have one problem that destination blockchain
    // can't verify transaction and we use oracles to solve it. Oracle verifies transaction
    // and if transaction is fine it signs it using its own private key. Now user by using his
    // signed proof can claim funds.
    //
    // P.S: we don't support ERC20/BEP20 tokens that charges fee
